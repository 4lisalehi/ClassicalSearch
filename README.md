# ClassicalSearch

First project of my "Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems" course, in Python 3

The project focuses on modeling problems in order to be solved using classical search algorithms.


### Requirements
In order to run the project, first you need to run the following command (in project directory) to install the requirements - which is only numpy here.
~~~bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~~~

You can also use "virtualenv" to install packages and run project in a virtual environment.
